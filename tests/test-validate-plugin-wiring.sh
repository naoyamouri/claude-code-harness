# Ratchet guard for scenario (a) of workflow-test-wiring red-team (2026-07-16):
# an implementing AI silently removing a test invocation from
# tests/validate-plugin.sh would keep CI green while dropping coverage.
# This pin lives in a different CI gate (check-consistency) than the file it
# guards, so shrinking coverage requires touching two independent gates.
#
# Policy (workflow-test-wiring.md): adding invocations is free — add the new
# script name to REQUIRED_INVOCATIONS in the same PR. Removing one requires
# updating this list too, which is exactly the visible, reviewable act the
# direction-asymmetric rule wants.
